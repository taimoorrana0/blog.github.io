I"•<p>While surfing YouTube a few days ago, I somehow found myself watching deleted scenes from the Tarantino movie Pulp Fiction. I came across this one, where I noticed something that perked my ears.</p>

<p>At about time 2:36, Winston â€œThe Wolfâ€ Wolfâ€™s girlfriend calls him â€œSeÃ±or Loboâ€.</p>

<p>This caught my attention, because just a few minutes earlier, I had rewatched the scene from earlier in the movie with Butchâ€™s taxi ride and his conversation with the driver â€¦ Esmeralda Villa <strong><em>Lobos</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Start at 1:57The scene focuses on her name as part of their conversation (starting at 1:57). And in fact, a few seconds later, Esmeralda asks Butch what his name means, drawing particular attention to the meaning of names. And would you have it, turns out the name <em>Lobos</em> does in fact mean â€œWolfâ€ in Spanish.</p>

<p>Now this might just be a completely random coincidence that two characters have last names that mean the same thing. But then again, this is Pulp Fiction weâ€™re talking about, a movie famously notorious for its many hidden easter eggs!</p>

<p>I do find it odd that I couldnâ€™t find any single mention on the internet about this, given the insane number of videos and articles covering the most random easter eggs in Tarantinoâ€™s movies!</p>
