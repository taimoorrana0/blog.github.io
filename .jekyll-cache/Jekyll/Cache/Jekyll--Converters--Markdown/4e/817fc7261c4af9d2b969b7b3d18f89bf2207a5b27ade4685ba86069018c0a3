I"²	<p>As Iâ€™ve just recently turned 21, I figure itâ€™s time I grew past my days of chugging Natty Lights in my frat house basement, and begin to appreciate some real liquor. Iâ€™ve started to look into different types of cocktails, and one that caught my eye (and tastebuds) was the Moscow Mule, particularly <a href="https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3817/moscow-mule-drink-recipe/">this recipe</a>. Excited to try my hand at making it, a friendâ€™s Thanksgiving party provided the perfect occasion.</p>

<p>After reading what seemed to be the simplest recipe ever, I headed over to the grocery store to pick up some Ginger Beer and Vodka (assuming the friend had some limes, cause who doesnâ€™t?).</p>

<p>At the store, however, I decided I needed to add some personal pizazz to the mix, not just follow a recipe literally called â€œThe Easiest Moscow Mule Recipeâ€. So, picked up some cinnamon sticks, cause why not? Cinnamon is delicious.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few hours at my friendâ€™s house. What do you know? She doesnâ€™t have any limesâ€¦ Defeated, I thought my first cocktail mixing experience had ended before it even started. And then, my friend pointed to her shelf, and said â€œWell, I do have some oranges?â€ What the hell, theyâ€™re both citrus, I guess? Put my concoction together, and what do you know, it was damn good!</p>

<p>Decided to name it a Florida Mule (cause oranges grow in Florida, at least according to the book <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tangerine_%28novel%29">Tangerine</a>, which I for some reason have in my head since 5th grade english class). Since then, itâ€™s become my signature cocktail! And so, without further ado, the recipe itself:</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>6 oz. Ginger Beer</li>
  <li>2 oz. Vodka</li>
  <li>1 orange slice (1/8 - 1/6 of orange)</li>
  <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Add vodka and ginger beer to mug (or cup)</li>
  <li>Squeeze orange slice into mug. Donâ€™t squeeze too hard as to squeeze rinds/pulp into the drink.</li>
  <li>Plop the rest of the orange slice into the mug.</li>
  <li>Add a stick of cinnamon.</li>
  <li>Stir to let the cinnamon flavor release into the drink. Youâ€™ll see it foam up a bit.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Add 2â€“3 ice cubes. Not necessary if the ginger beer was already cold.</li>
</ol>
