One day, while randomly surfing the Berkeley EECS page, I came across a post from some random person advertising that they would pay half of TC Disrupt ticket if we advertise for them. Interested, I followed up and met Michael and Kenneth, the co-founders of PIF. And from there, my roommates and I ended up interning for them at TechCrunch Disrupt. However, to cut over the noise of the other 500 startups there, we realized we had to do something different. And that’s why we trolled TechCrunch (yes, we almost got kicked out!). Read about it [here in Michael’s article](https://medium.com/the-pif-chronicles/how-we-hacked-techcrunch-disrupt-f62f9f9f8dd7).
