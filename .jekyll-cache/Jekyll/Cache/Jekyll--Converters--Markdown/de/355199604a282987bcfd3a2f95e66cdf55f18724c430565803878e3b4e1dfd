  <p>â€œI wonder if anyone in the architecture profession has ever proclaimed `â€Well if you really want to change the world, empower regular people to build skyscrapers.â€ Probably not. And yet the programming profession seems to be constantly obsessed with making the field accessible to everybody and her sister, as if programming should be something any idiot off the street can do easily.â€</p>
