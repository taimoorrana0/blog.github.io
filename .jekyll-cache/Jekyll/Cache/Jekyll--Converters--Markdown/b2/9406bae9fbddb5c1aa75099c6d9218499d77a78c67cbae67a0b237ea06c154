I"×<p>I was recently watching clips of movies on YouTube, as I often find myself doing, and ran across this one from Marvelâ€™s <em>The Avengers.</em></p>

<p>Director Nick Fury warns Captain America, who has been frozen in ice since WW2, that â€œthe world has gotten even stranger than you already knowâ€ to which Cap replies â€œat this point, I doubt anything would surprise meâ€. Fury challenges him to a $10 bet that heâ€™s wrong.</p>

<p>A couple scenes later in the film, we see the SHIELD â€œhelicarrierâ€ take off and activate its invisibility panels. Amazed at this spectacle, Cap subtly hands Fury a $10 bill.</p>

<p>Watching this a second time, I couldnâ€™t help but be reminded of this one Peter Thiel quote I really like (<a href="/quote-of-the-month-february-2017.html">in fact it was one of my quotes of the month</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œWe wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.â€</p>

  <p>â€” Peter Thiel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially Peter Thiel is lamenting the lack of progress in â€œphysical innovationâ€. While weâ€™ve had great advances in the world of bits, thereâ€™s been little advancement in the world of Atoms, especially when compared to the expectation of 20th century â€œscience-fictionâ€™sâ€ imagining of the 21st century. David Graeber expands upon this lamentation far more eloquently in <a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/of-flying-cars-and-the-declining-rate-of-profit">this article</a>, where he presents a theory that a shift from industrial capitalism to neoliberal capitalism is to be blame for the declining rate of technological innovation.</p>

<hr />

<p>I present my own theory <a href="/innovation-through-economic-states-of-exception.html">in a previous post</a>, where I attribute the lack of â€œhigh risk physical innovationâ€ to the lack of â€œeconomic states of exceptionâ€, and reject the notion that there has been no innovation, but rather it has just shifted to the primary battlefield of modern war, the cyberspace. You can read this here:</p>

<p>I found it kind of sad that what amazed Steve Rodgers about the â€œmodernâ€ world was a piece of science fiction: flying aircraft carriers and invisibility panels. I felt, to drive the point home, this was purposefully presented in context of an aircraft carrier. During WW2, aircraft carrierâ€™s were perhaps one of the most technologically marvelous creations the world had seen, literally entire floating cities and airports. However, since WW2, theyâ€™ve seen little (visible) advancement, and the only way to impress Cap about them was to use science fiction rather than show off any real innovation theyâ€™ve seen in the last 70 years.</p>

<p>Now, itâ€™s completely possible that the weirdness Nick Fury referred to just meant in context of the magic and Norse gods in the Marvel universe (but then why was the resolution of the bet about technology?) and it was just meant to get a quick audience laugh. Maybe Iâ€™m just reading too much into it. Or maybe its possible Joss Whedon was sneaking in a subtle commentary on technopessimism? Idk.</p>
