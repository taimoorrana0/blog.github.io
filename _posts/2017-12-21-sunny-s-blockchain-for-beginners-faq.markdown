#### What’s all the hype around these blockchain and cryptocurrency things?

For an introduction to blockchains and why they’re exciting, read this three part articles series by my friend [Ashley Lannquist](https://medium.com/u/56f55b4f0c2b).

- [Blockchains, Cryptocurrencies & the New Decentralized Economy: Part 1 — A Gentle Introduction](https://blockchainatberkeley.blog/blockchains-cryptocurrencies-the-new-decentralized-economy-part-1-a-gentle-introduction-edcb4824b174) 
- [Blockchains, Cryptocurrencies & the New Decentralized Economy: Part 2 — Blockchain-Based Apps](https://blockchainatberkeley.blog/blockchains-cryptocurrencies-the-new-decentralized-economy-part-2-blockchain-based-apps-e6ea71236ca)

Alternatively, if you’re more of an audio-visual learner, check out this presentation by my friend [Max Fang](https://medium.com/u/31627e5cf244).

#### Wow, those were super cool! I want to go really deep into this stuff and learn more! Where should I start?

I suggest the UC Berkeley Blockchain Fundamentals Decal course that I co-designed.

All the materials are online here: [Blockchain Fundamental Decal](https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/decal/fa17/fund/)

The YouTube playlist is here: [Blockchain Fundamentals Decal Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSONl1AVlZNXVI1dobdDrwv2hhIgemJuA)

#### I’m a developer. How do I get into blockchain application development?

For the moment, I would suggest focusing on Ethereum. I’m not convinced that their paradigm is optimal, however, for now until we release more material from Cosmos Academy on how to develop using Tendermint / Cosmos, Ethereum is the best starting point to hit the ground running.

I highly suggest using the following handbook I created during my time at ConsenSys

- [Introduction · A Beginner's Guide to Ethereum and Dapp Development](https://sunnya97.gitbooks.io/a-beginner-s-guide-to-ethereum-and-dapp-developme/content/) 

Alternatively, if you prefer a more guided course, two of my friends, [Ali Mousa](https://medium.com/u/22faf93c75c2) and [Collin Chin](https://medium.com/u/f720d66bf162) from Blockchain at Berkeley, created this course (note it has a cost of $150):

#### Why is Bitcoin price rising?

I don’t know. [This article](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/11/bitcoin-delusion-conquer-world/547187/) does a decent job of at least laying out some of the theories.

---

#### Is Bitcoin in a bubble?

Probably. But all money is a bubble!

---

#### I don’t understand the economics of Bitcoin. Where does this stuff get value from? How does it make sense if a government doesn’t back it?

Read [this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Help:FAQ#Where_does_the_value_of_Bitcoin_stem_from.3F_What_backs_up_Bitcoin.3F).

---

#### Should I invest in …?

I don’t give investment advice. To be honest, you probably don’t want my advice anyways, I don’t know much about trading and stuff. Feel free to ask me what I think of the technicals of a protocol though!

---

#### But I want to get into trading! How do I learn?

My friend [Jon Allen](https://medium.com/u/7c343e76d13e), co-head of Blockchain at Berkeley, has published two courses on Cryptocurrency Trading. I suggest checking them out.

- [CryptoCurrencies Trading Explained (Free)](https://bab.teachable.com/p/crypto-trading-intro)
- [Advanced Cryptocurrency Trading ($100)](https://bab.teachable.com/p/advanced-cryptocurrency-trading)

Drop me an email at [sunnya97@protonmail.ch](mailto:sunnya97@protonmail.ch) or just message me however you normally do if you know me.

#### Wow, this FAQ was awesome! How can I tip you?

I accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic. And if you’re super lame, plain old Venmo works too ;)

* **BTC / BCH:** 3NT7b6KNs1kTBJu5fSap1mLGrGQR3ebDxD
* **ETH / ETC:** 0xe17A702c7264AB8602e7fDf4d89d8045301E80b9
* **Venmo:** @sunnya97
And before anyone mentions it, yes, I’m aware of the possibility of replay attacks on ETH and ETC if I’m using the same address. I know how to deal with it :)
