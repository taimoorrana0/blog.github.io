<p>Besides, the electoral college doesnâ€™t shift attention away from â€œbigâ€ states to â€œsmallâ€ states. It simply shifts them to a few â€œbattleground statesâ€. We can fix this. It doesnâ€™t even need a Constitutional Amendment. It could be done with the agreement of enough states with over 50% of the electoral college voting power.
